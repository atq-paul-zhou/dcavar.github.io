The code generates an FSA from a list of words and generate a DOT file
(for visualization in for example Graphviz).

The file FSA.py is required. Make sure it is in the path or next to
Wlist2RE.py.

Run with Python, having a list of words in a text-file "wordlist.txt":

python Wlist2RE.py wordlist.txt

The output will be written in the file out.dot. This file can be opened in
Graphviz for visualization.

or make Wlist2RE.py executable.

The word list is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8. This can be changed in the
code below.
