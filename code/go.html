<h3><a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a></h3>
<p>I developed a HTTPS server to communicate with an <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/">Alexa skill</a>
   from an independent AWS instance to process queries and requests linguistically using Natural Language Processing
   (NLP) pipelines to query a Knowledge Graph using common Graph databases like Neo4J (Cypher) and
   Stardog (using SPARQL).</p>
<p>The art in this project was to develop an HTTPS server in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> that receives and returns welformed Alexa SDK JSON, and that also communicates with our Microservice infrastructure on the AWS instance using XML-RPC or JSON-RPC.</p>
