  abstract = {During the last few years, a new approach to language processing has
	started to emerge, which has become known under the name of "Data
	Oriented Parsing" or "DOP". This approach embodies the assumption
	that human language comprehension and production works with representations
	of concrete past language experiences, rather than with abstract
	grammatical rules. The models that instantiate this approach therefore
	maintain corpora of linguistic representations of previously occurring
	utterances. New utterance-representations are constructed by freely
	combining partial structures from the corpus. A probability model
	is used to choose from the collection of different structures of
	different sizes those that make up the most appropriate representation
	of an utterance.
	
	In this book, DOP models for several kinds of linguistic representations
	are developed, ranging from tree representations, compositional semantic
	representations, attribute-value representations, and dialogue representations.
	These models are studied from a formal, linguistic and computational
	perspective and are tested with available language corpora. The main
	outcome of these tests suggests that the productive units of natural
	language cannot be defined in terms of a minimal set of rules (or
	constraints or principles), as is usually attempted in linguistic
	theory, but need to be defined in terms of a large, redundant set
	of previously experienced structures with virtually no restriction
	on their size and complexity. I will argue that this outcome has
	important consequences for linguistic theory, leading to a new notion
	of language competence. In particular, it means that the knowledge
	of a speaker/hearer cannot be understood as a grammar, but as a statistical
	ensemble of language experiences that changes slightly every time
	a new utterance is processed.},

	The Minimalist Program consists of four recent essays that attempt
	to situate linguistic theory in the broader cognitive sciences. In
	these essays the minimalist approach to linguistic theory is formulated
	and progressively developed. Building on the theory of principles
	and parameters and, in particular, on principles of economy of derivation
	and representation, the minimalist framework takes Universal Grammar
	as providing a unique computational system, with derivations driven
	by morphological properties, to which the syntactic variation of
	languages is also restricted.
	
	
	Within this theoretical framework, linguistic expressions are generated
	by optimally efficient derivations that must satisfy the conditions
	that hold on interface levels, the only levels of linguistic representation.
	The interface levels provide instructions to two types of performance
	systems, articulatory-perceptual and conceptual- intentional. All
	syntactic conditions, then, express properties of these interface
	levels, reflecting the interpretive requirements of language and
	keeping to very restricted conceptual resources.},

	is supported by the performance of an implementation of this parsing
	algorithm which determines a recursive unlabeled bracketing of unrestricted
	English text with a relatively low error rate. This paper derives
	the generalized mutual information statistic, describes the parsing
	algorithm, and presents results and sample output from the parser.

	In this book Mark Steedman argues that the surface syntax of natural
	languages maps spoken and written forms directly to a compositional
	semantic representation that includes predicate-argument structure,
	quantification, and information structure, without constructing any
	intervening structural representation. His purpose is to construct
	a principled theory of natural grammar that is directly compatible
	with both explanatory linguistic accounts of a number of problematic
	syntactic phenomena and a straightforward computational account of
	the way sentences are mapped onto representations of meaning. The
	radical nature of Steedman's proposal stems from his claim that much
	of the apparent complexity of syntax, prosody, and processing follows
	from the lexical specification of the grammar and from the involvement
	of a small number of universal rule-types for combining predicates
	and arguments. These syntactic operations are related to the combinators
	of Combinatory Logic, engendering a much freer definition of derivational
	constituency than is traditionally assumed. This property allows
	Combinatory Categorial Grammar to capture elegantly the structure
	and interpretation of coordination and intonation contour in English
	as well as some well-known interactions between word order, coordination,
	and relativization across a number of other languages. It also allows
	more direct compatibility with incremental semantic interpretation
	during parsing.
	
	
	The book covers topics in formal linguistics, intonational phonology,
	computational linguistics, and experimental psycholinguistics, presenting
	them as an integrated theory of the language faculty in a form accessible
	to readers from any of those fields.},
