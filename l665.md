# CSCI-B 659 Topics in Artificial Intelligence
# LING-L 665 Applying Machine Learning Techniques in Computational Linguistics - Neural Networks, Deep Learning for CL/NLP


## Introduction

This is a graduate course that focuses on the introducing of machine learning techniques that are used in Computational Linguistics.

Machine learning problems in CL are rather non-typical for machine learning because natural language includes a significant level of exceptions. The course will provide an overview of the most important machine learning algorithms, but it will mostly focus on how to apply machine learning to CL problems such as co-reference resolution, morphological analysis, parsing, and word sense disambiguation. In addition to the numerous underlying tasks in ML for CL (and NLP) applications, we will discuss deep learning approaches. We will work with neural network models applied to traditional CL and NLP problems.

Among others, we will cover word vector representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models, recursive neural networks, convolutional neural networks, etc.

The course is a series of lectures and hands-on programming exercises.

The course is using material provided by:

- Stanford University: [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
- The [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) textbook (MIT Press) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville
- Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) (3rd ed. draft)
- University of Oxford: [Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing: 2016-2017](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2016-2017/dl/) by Phil Blunsom

These courses are accompanied by videos, slides, research papers, links to supplemental material and tutorials, and other very valuable information. Please use these resources during our course.


# Prerequisites and Requirements

I expect that you are able or acquire the skills to code examples in Python or Go. If you have no programming experience, follow the different links here and on the mentioned course sites and learn Python and Numpy.


**Recommended:**

- Learn [Python] or [Go]; if you have never programmed before, learn [Python] first; I recommend using [Python] 3.x or the most recent distribution of [Go]
- Install and learn about [TensorFlow], [Word2vec]
- Refresh your knowledge of Calculus and Linear Algebra
- Update your knowledge of Probability Theory
- Refresh your knowledge of common Machine Learning approaches
- Familiarize yourself with common Linguistic concepts and theories, in particular lexical properties, syntax, semantics, speech; for basic introductions consult Jurafsky and Martin or 


# Literature

I do not require any textbook, I recommend the following:

- Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. Speech and Language Processing (3rd
ed. draft) ([available online](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/))
- Yoav Goldberg. A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language
Processing. ([download paper](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/nnlp.pdf))
- Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Deep Learning. MIT
Press. ([read online](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/), [book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/))

We will read the following papers:

- ...

Recommended tutorials:

- [Python and Numpy](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
- [Linear Algebra](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf)
- [Word2vec tutorial]
- [TensorFlow tutorial]



# Policies

## Academic Integrity

(from the Dean for Academic Standards and Opportunities) As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct ([*http://www.iu.edu/~code/*](http://www.iu.edu/%7Ecode/)). When you submit an assignment with your name on it, you are signifying that the work contained therein is all yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or exam, be sure to seek clarification beforehand. All suspected violations of the Code will be handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final course grade, a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities, and must include a report to the Dean of Students who may impose additional disciplinary sanctions.


## Students with Disabilities

Students who need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me to arrange an
appointment as soon as possible to discuss the course format, to anticipate needs, and to explore potential accommodations.

I rely on Disability Services for Students for assistance in verifying the need for accommodations and developing accommodation strategies. Students who have not previously contacted Disability Services are encouraged to do so (812-855-7578; [*http://www.indiana.edu/~iubdss/*](http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eiubdss/)).


## CAPS

One benefit of a school like IU is that there are many, many resources available to you. School and life can be intense at times, and if your academic responsibilities or other personal concerns are distracting or weighing on you this semester, I encourage you to contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) (812) 855-5711, http://healthcenter.indiana.edu/counseling/). The people there can be a resource and a source of support, not just in times of crisis, but also when you need an extra ear or a little extra support. Iâ€™m happy to be a listening ear, as well, but I have no counseling training and the folks at CAPS do. Note, too, that I am required to report certain things (e.g., reports of sexual assault, suicidal thoughts).
